# Renaissance Re Reinsurance Analysis

## Overview

Renaissance Re insures a variety of commercial and residential properties. Each policy covers a combination of building value, contents value, and business interruption costs. Policyholders are responsible for a deductible on a loss, which is retained by them. 

Renaissance Re is seeking to purchase a reinsurance contract to protect against catastrophic events. This contract would provide coverage for losses exceeding a $5 million USD deductible, with a limit of $5 million USD for each catastrophic event.

### Insurance Policies
The insurance policies in the portfolio cover:
- **Building Coverage**: Value of the insured buildings.
- **Contents Coverage**: Value of the items within the buildings.
- **Business Interruption Coverage**: Losses incurred due to the inability to operate during or after a catastrophe.
  
### Deductible and Limit
The reinsurance contract in question includes:
- **Deductible**: $5 million USD retained by Renaissance Re for each individual catastrophic event.
- **Limit**: $5 million USD in reinsurance coverage for any losses exceeding the deductible.

### Data Sources
- **Exposure Information**: Details of the policies insured by Renaissance Re.
- **Results Tab**: Outputs from a probabilistic catastrophe model, simulating 50,000 years of hurricanes and providing the loss details for each hurricane where the company’s losses exceeded $0.
- **CurrencyDetails Tab**: Includes exchange rates necessary to convert losses reported in multiple currencies into USD.

## Key Insights

### Total Insured Value (TIV)
- **Massachusetts Dominates by TIV**: Massachusetts holds the highest Total Insured Value (TIV) in the portfolio, reaching $1.2 billion USD, which reflects a significant concentration of risk. This is broken down into building, contents, and business interruption coverage.
  
- **Limited Data for Some States**: Smaller TIV figures for states like Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Maine may indicate fewer policies and lower property values.

- **Minimal Business Interruption Coverage**: The data shows that business interruption coverage is underrepresented, suggesting that this risk may be underinsured across the portfolio.

### Hurricane Simulation Model Results
- The catastrophe model simulates potential losses over 50,000 years of hurricane events.
- The output lists the company’s loss for each simulated hurricane event that resulted in a loss greater than $0.
- These losses must be converted to USD using the exchange rates provided in the CurrencyDetails tab.

### Reinsurance Coverage Implications
- **Event Trigger**: The reinsurance contract will apply only when a catastrophic event results in losses exceeding the $5 million USD deductible.
- **Maximum Payout**: For each event, the maximum payout from the reinsurer will be capped at $5 million USD.

## Recommendations

1. **Evaluate Massachusetts's Insurance Strategy**: Given the notably high TIV in Massachusetts, further analysis is necessary to ensure that the current premium structures are adequately priced for the risk exposure. It is critical to assess the concentration of risk in this area and the potential impact of catastrophic events.

2. **Assess Underinsurance Risks**: A detailed review should be conducted to address possible underinsurance, especially regarding business interruption coverage. Renaissance Re should consider encouraging policyholders to opt for more comprehensive coverage options to better align with their risk profiles.

3. **Optimize Risk Management**: Review and refine risk management and underwriting practices to align better with the distribution of risks and insured values, particularly in regions like Massachusetts with high TIV.

## Conclusion
Renaissance Re can leverage the insights from this analysis, particularly regarding the concentration of risk in Massachusetts, to refine their reinsurance strategy. By addressing underinsurance and optimizing premium structures, they can mitigate potential risks and improve overall risk management.
